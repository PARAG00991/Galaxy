my first Github repository

As I am a new user here on Github, so I am starting with writing some information regarding myself only(for eg. my likes and dislikes :D ).

                                         ----------------------------------------

####* My Name is Parag Jain.
#####* I am currently pursuing my B.Tech. course from National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur (H.P.). I am presently studying in third year and yeah,i know despite being a student of computer science and engineering , I haven't contributed anything till now to open source. Though, I got to know about Github after first year but I never had given it much importance and didn't ever feel like to give a try.
#####* Now, I think time has come for me to start contributing something to open source(Feeling excited :grin:) and yeah, I love :coffee: and :strawberry: .
